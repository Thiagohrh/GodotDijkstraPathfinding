# GodotDijkstraPathfinding
A tool Im developing in order to make a crude pathfinding node. Meant to be used on another game im working on, but generic enough so i can improve/modify it in order to suit future needs.
If you click anywhere in the screen, the sprite instanced finds the path to the FURTHEST node from the click position, then follows a path using Dijkstra to it.
